    "### The Method of Comparison\n",
    "The basic method to mitigate confounding is to compare(at least) two groups, one that receives _treatment_ and a _control group_ that does not (or that gets a different treatment).\n",
    "To minimize bias, the treatment group and the control group should be as similar as possible but for the fact that\n",
    "one gets treatment and the other does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If subjects _self-select_ for treatment, that generally results in bias. So does allowing the experimenter flexibility to select the groups.\n",
    "The best way to minimize bias, and to be able to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting inferences, is to assign subjects to treatment or control _randomly_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For human subjects, the mere fact of receiving treatment&mdash;even a treatment with no real effect&mdash;can\n",
    "produce changes in response. This is called _the placebo effect_.\n",
    "For that reason, it is important that human subjects be _blind_ to whether they are treated or not, for instance,\n",
    "by giving subjects in the control group a _placebo_.\n",
    "That makes the treatment and control groups more similar.\n",
    "Both groups receive something: the difference is in _what_ they\n",
    "receive, rather than _whether_ they receive anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, subjective elements can deliberately or inadvertently enter the assessment of subjects' responses to treatment,\n",
    "making it important for the people assessing the responses to be _blind_ to which subjects received treatment.\n",
    "When neither the subjects nor the assessors know who was treated, the experiment is _double blind_.\n",
