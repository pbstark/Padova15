    "# Inference and Statistical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is based partly on Freedman, D.A., 2009. [_Statistical Models: Theory and Practice_, Revised Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Models-Practice-David-Freedman/dp/0521743850/), Cambridge University Press.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical models, and regression in particular, are used primarily for three purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Description_: to summarize data\n",
    "2. _Prediction_: to predict future data\n",
    "3. _Causal Inference_: to predict what would happen in response to an intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to check whether a regression model is a good summary of _existing_ data, although there is some subtlety in determining whether the summary is _good enough_.  How to measure goodness of fit appropriately is not always obvious, and adequacy of fit depends on the use of the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction is harder than description because it involves _extrapolation_: how can one tell what the future will bring? Why should the future be like the past? Is the system under study stable (i.e., _stationary_) or are its properties changing with time?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the hardest of these tasks is causal inference. The biggest difficulty in drawing causal inferences is _confounding_, especially when the data arise from _observational studies_ rather than _randomized, controlled experiments_. (_Natural experiments_ lie somewhere in between; there are few that approach the utility of\n",
    "a randomized controlled experiment, but John Snow's study of the communication of cholera is a notable exception.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Confounding_ happens when one factor or variable manifests in the outcome in a way that cannot be distinguished from the _treatment_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stratification_ (e.g., _cross tabulation_) can help reduce confounding. So can modeling&mdash;in some cases, but not in others. \n",
    "For modeling to help, it is generally necessary for the structure of the model to \n",
    "correspond to how the data were actually generated.\n",
    "Unfortunately, most models in science, especially social science, are chosen out of habit or computational\n",
    "convenience, not because they have a basis in the science itself.\n",
    "This often produces misleading results, and the misleading impression that those results have small\n",
    "uncertainties.\n"

    "### The Method of Comparison\n",
    "The basic method to mitigate confounding is to compare(at least) two groups, one that receives _treatment_ and a _control group_ that does not (or that gets a different treatment).\n",
    "To minimize bias, the treatment group and the control group should be as similar as possible but for the fact that\n",
    "one gets treatment and the other does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If subjects _self-select_ for treatment, that generally results in bias. So does allowing the experimenter flexibility to select the groups.\n",
    "The best way to minimize bias, and to be able to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting inferences, is to assign subjects to treatment or control _randomly_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For human subjects, the mere fact of receiving treatment&mdash;even a treatment with no real effect&mdash;can\n",
    "produce changes in response. This is called _the placebo effect_.\n",
    "For that reason, it is important that human subjects be _blind_ to whether they are treated or not, for instance,\n",
    "by giving subjects in the control group a _placebo_.\n",
    "That makes the treatment and control groups more similar.\n",
    "Both groups receive something: the difference is in _what_ they\n",
    "receive, rather than _whether_ they receive anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, subjective elements can deliberately or inadvertently enter the assessment of subjects' responses to treatment,\n",
    "making it important for the people assessing the responses to be _blind_ to which subjects received treatment.\n",
    "When neither the subjects nor the assessors know who was treated, the experiment is _double blind_.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [SticiGui: Does Treatment Have an Effect?](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/experiments.htm) for more discussion."

    "Is it because they smoke?\n",

    "## The 2-sample problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a group of $N$ individuals who are randomized into two groups, a _treatment_ group of size $N_t$ and a _control_ group of size $N_c = N - N_t$.\n",
    "Label the individuals from $1$ to $N$.\n",
    "Let ${\\mathcal T}$ denote the labels of individuals assigned to treatment and ${\\mathcal C}$ denote \n",
    "the labels of those assigned to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the $N$ individuals, we measure a quantitative (real-valued) response.\n",
    "Each individual $i$ has two _potential responses_: the response $c_i $individual would have if assigned to \n",
    "the control group, and the response $t_i$ the individual would have if assigned to the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that individul $i$'s response depends _only_ on that individual's assigment, and not on anyone else's assignment.\n",
    "This is the assumption of _non-interference_. \n",
    "In some cases, this assumption is reasonable; in others, it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine testing a vaccine for a communicable disease.\n",
    "If you and I have contact, whether you get the disease might depend on whether I am vaccinated&mdash;and _vice versa_&mdash;since if the vaccine protects me from illness, I won't infect you.\n",
    "Similarly, suppose we are testing the effectiveness of an advertisement for a product.\n",
    "If you and I are connected and you buy the product, I might be more likely to buy it, even if I don't\n",
    "see the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, suppose that \"treatment\" is exposure to a carcinogen, and the response whether the\n",
    "subject contracts cancer. \n",
    "On the assumption that cancer is not communicable, my exposure and your disease\n",
    "status have no connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _strong null hypothesis_ is that individual by individual, treatment makes no difference whatsoever: $c_i = t_i$ for all $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, any differences between statistics computed for the treatment and control groups are entirely due to the luck of the draw: which individuals happened to be assigned to treatment and which to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the _null distribution_ of any statistic computed from the responses of the two groups: if the strong null hypothesis is true, we know what individual $i$'s response would have been whether assigned to treatment or to control&mdash;namely, the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose we suspect that treatment tends to increase response: in general, $t_i \\ge c_i$.\n",
    "Then we might expect $\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{N_c} \\sum_{i \\in {\\mathcal C}} c_i$ to be less than\n",
    "$\\bar{t} = \\frac{1}{N_t} \\sum_{i \\in {\\mathcal T}} t_i$.\n",
    "How large a difference between $\\bar{c}$ and $\\bar{t}$ would be evidence that treatment increases the response,\n",
    "beyond what might happen by chance through the luck of the draw?\n",
    "\n",
    "This amounts to asking whether the observed difference in means between the two groups is a high percentile\n",
    "of the distribution of that difference in means, calculated on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how subjects are assigned to treatment or to control, all allocations of $N_t$ subjects to\n",
    "treatment are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to partition the $N$ subjects randomly into a group of size $N_c$ and a group of size $N_t$ is\n",
    "to permute the $N$ subjects at random, then take the first $N_c$ in the permuted list to be the control\n",
