Notes
Revised numbers are revised from the original source.  
Passenger-kilometers, total: Is not the sum of the subcategories because local motor bus is included in both the road and transit totals. This double counting has been removed from the overall total. 
Road data for 1990-2006 use the categories passenger car and light truck. Road data for 2007-09 use new categories under a new methodology which is not comparable to that of previous years. The new category Light duty vehicle, short wheel base includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) with a wheel base equal to or less than 121 inches. The new category Light duty vehicle, long wheel base includes large passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs with a wheel base longer than 121 inches. 
1 kilometer = approximately 0.621371 miles.

Technical Documentation
Air: Air data comprise air carrier and general aviation passenger-kilometers. Air carrier data in the United States are based on 100 percent reporting of passengers and trip length by the large certificated air carriers (including the medium regional carriers). There are some 90 air carriers that operate aircraft with a passenger seating capacity of more than 60, or have a payload capacity of more than 8,165 kilograms, or operate internationally. (See the technical notes under Table 4-1 for more information on large certificated air carriers.) Large certificated carriers have reported data for the entire period above. There are some 50 non-large certificated carriers that began reporting under a consistent set of rules in October 2002. Data for on-demand air taxis are excluded for the entire period above and non-large certificated carriers are excluded for 1990-2001. If added in the years of exclusion, these might raise the totals by less than 5 percent. Air carrier passenger-kilometers are computed by summing the aircraft kilometers flown on each inter-airport segment multiplied by the number of passengers carried on that segment.

Road: Road data are based on statistics compiled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) at the U.S. Department of Transportation from data reported by each state. Road passenger-kilometers are calculated by multiplying the vehicle kilometers of travel by the average number of occupants for each vehicle type (as estimate by FHWA, using various sources, especially, the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey). The quality of the data varies by the level of the functional road system and by each state?s effort and adherence to FHWA methods. FHWA edits reports that are unreasonable because of obvious errors or large changes. In July 1997, FHWA published revised passenger-kilometers data for the road mode for several years. The major change reflected the reassignment of some vehicles from the passenger car category to the FHWA category "other 2-axle, 4-tire vehicles" (called "light truck" in this table). Light trucks include vans, pick-up trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles. Passenger cars include taxis. Bus totals are based on data from the FHWA and include charter, intercity, local motor bus and school bus. Local motor bus is based on data from a private association, and is described under transit. Road data do not include passenger travel by commercial freight vehicles.

Transit: Transit data are from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and are based on information in the Federal Transit Administration?s (FTA) National Transit Database. APTA conservatively adjusts the FTA data to include transit operators that do not report to this database. These non-reporting operators typically include private, very small and/or rural operators. There are about 6,000 transit operators in the U.S., according to APTA; about 1,000 of these operators report to FTA. However, these 1,000 operators account for approximately 90 to 95 percent of the total transit passenger-kilometers. Reliability of the U.S. transit data varies by mode. The numbers for rail are the most comprehensive; those for bus are less so because there are so many more operators. Transit passenger-kilometers are the cumulative sum of the distances ridden by each passenger. Transit total includes other U.S. transit categories not individually specified here, including local motor bus, trolley bus, ferries and transit for the disabled. Transit rail includes commuter rail, heavy rail and light rail. Local motor bus included here is not included in the total to avoid double counting with the estimate of bus passenger vehicle-kilometers in the road data.
Intercity rail: Intercity rail data are based on an almost 100 percent count of tickets from the service provider in the United States (Amtrak) and, therefore, are considered to be very accurate.
